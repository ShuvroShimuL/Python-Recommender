Implementing an algorithm based on the collaborative filtering technique applied to movie recommendations (user-based filtering and item-based filtering). 
Used the MovieLens dataset, which has more than 100k instances
MovieLens data sets were collected by the GroupLens Research Project
This data set consists of:
	* 100,000 ratings (1-5) from 943 users on 1682 movies. 
	* Each user has rated at least 20 movies. 
  * Simple demographic info for the users (age, gender, occupation, zip)
